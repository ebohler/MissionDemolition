# Mission Demolition - Evan Bohler
✓ Correct Unity Gitignore  
✓ Game over screen with play again button (and victory screen for completing all 4 levels)  
✓ 4 levels with castles different from book  
✓ Line renderer to draw rubber band when holding mouse button  
✓ Slingshot firing sound  
✓ Cooler in a meaningful way: Changed the rules so that instead of having a shots fired counter, you get 10 shots per level. Once you fire your last shot you get a 15-second grace period to let one of the balls roll into the goal before you get a game over.
